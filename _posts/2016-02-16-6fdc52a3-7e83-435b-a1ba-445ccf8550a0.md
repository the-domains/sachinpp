* Longing wishes of an old woman,  
Against the doors of the eternal heaven,  
Meets the dark waves of time and pain,  
To dance in the eternity of separation so plain,  
Because life's last wish is a beautiful lie,  
Which turns the frown to a smile,  
And longing for it is the painful truth,
* to which death himself is uncouth
